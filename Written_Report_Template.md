### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
It can be concluded that the smaller the goal is the more likely it is that it will be successful

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations is the outcome designated as "live." There are 51 data points that really missed because of this. Also, since the goal and pledged data is presented in USD the currency column is irrelevant unless we convert to currency. Also, did some of the "failed" campaigns ultimately go "live?"

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
