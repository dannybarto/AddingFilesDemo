# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to utilize the Kickstarter information to determine whether or not there are particular factors involved in successful outcomes and what the information can tell us about the prospects for Louise's Kickstarter for her own play, Fever.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first thing I noted is that the months of May through July are the best time to launch a campaign. The number of is fairly negligible across the year while the number of failures loosely tracks with success but the gap does begin to close starting in October and running through December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data for outcomes based on goals tells us that smaller goals have a better chance for success. In fact, there is an inverse relationship between the goal amount and whether or not it was failed or successful. At the $15,000 to $19,999 level there is an even chance of success or failure. Between $35,000 to $49,999 is a small window where higher goals correspond to a better chance for success over failure but the number of campaigns in this window is very small compared to the lower goals. I would say the best chance for success would be to set the goal somewhere between less than $1,000 to $19,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - It looks like mid year is the ideal time to launch a campaign
  - The 4th quarter has a higher fail rate relative to successful campaigns that the rest of the year

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 

It can be concluded that the smaller the goal is the more likely it is that it will be successful

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  -   One of the limitations is the outcome designated as "live." There are 51 data points that really missed because of this. Also, since the goal and pledged data    is presented in USD the currency column is irrelevant unless we convert to currency. Also, did some of the "failed" campaigns ultimately go "live?" I also think    that Outcomes Based on Launch Date could be misleading because there is a larger set to look at for some months over others. So while we can look at springtime       being ideal for launch we might also consider that it is due to the fact that this is when the most campaigns have been launched previously.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
